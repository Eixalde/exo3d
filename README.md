# Exo3D

Library handling the 3D display of exoplanets for the exoplanet.eu website

## Description

Display an exoplanet or an exoplanetary system while showing graphically their
main characteristics. It is design to work with the from the exoplanet.eu
website and database. It is then possible to see a representation - either
scientifically accurate or didactic - of a chosen exoplanet among the thousands
listed on the website. The exoplanet can be shown alone, or in its system. Thus
we can look the star(s) it is dependant of, and if it is in the habitability
zone.

## Goals

- Have a large number of users smoothly navigating on the application
  (regardless of the support or browser)
- Keep a realistic representation of every element of each system
- Adapt the application to the database as much as possible, while anticipating
  future additions and prospective changes
